									t was March 12, 2020, a week before California would be under stay-at-home orders due to COVID-19—and it was downpouring in Los Angeles. <br>
									From the fourth floor of the <span class="color-theme2">WGAW</span> building, we watched as the flooded Whole Foods parking lot swarmed with panic-buying customers. Hard raindrops slammed against the floor-to-ceiling windows, and the usual electricity in the air from a rare Southland storm was supplanted by the knowledge that a pandemic had, like the rain, moved in on us. Both felt like they were here to stay.
								</p>
								<p>“I feel like the whole world has gone upside down,” said <span class="color-theme2">Patty Jenkins</span>, settling into her chair.
								</p>
								<p>“Something’s changing,” observed  <span class="color-theme2">Dave Callaham</span>. <span class="color-theme2">Geoff Johns</span> wondered aloud if road closures would prevent them from making their separate ways back home that evening.</p>
								<p>Jenkins echoed, “I think it’s changing forever.”
								</p>
								<p>Case in point: most of us had waved and smiled rather than shaking hands that morning. Too, we had all utilized the newly installed hand sanitizing stations by the elevators as we passed them. And as we geared up for this interview in a conference room at Guild headquarters, we talked about an impending quarantine like we were reading from a science fiction script.
								</p>
								<p>“This might be the inception of the next project you do together,” I said—however naively—to the co-writers of Wonder Woman 1984 (screenplay by Patty Jenkins & Geoff Johns & Dave Callaham, story by Jenkins & Johns).</p>
								<p>“There are going to be a million of these after this,” Johns said. Then, about doing an interview on the cusp of lockdown and in the wake of a deadly virus, he continued: “Cut to 50 years from now, guys in hazmat suits, they’ll find the recording. ‘What is this recording? The last interview!’”
								</p>
								<p>It was certainly the last interview I did before the stilllargely-in-place quarantine. And at the time of the interview, nobody expected Wonder Woman 1984’s release date to be pushed from June, to August, and now to October of 2020 due to the pandemic (at time of publication). Everyone just wanted to discuss the work.</p>

								<p><strong>Jacqueline Primo: Geoff, your credits include writing on Blade: The Series, Smallville, Arrow, the Aquaman feature, as well as creating Stargirl. You have served as the president and chief creative officer at DC Comics, and were co-executive producer of 2017’s Wonder Woman [screenplay by Allan Heinberg, story by Zack Snyder & Heinberg and Jason Fuchs, directed by Patty Jenkins]. Clearly you are no stranger to superheroes. What set you on this trajectory?
								</strong></p>
								<p><strong>Patty Jenkins:</strong> He’s also the most prolific comic book writer in DC history.
									</p>
								<p><strong>Geoff Johns:</strong> I think I’ve written more comics for DC than anybody except Robert Kanigher, who created most of the characters in the ’50s and ’60s. I just love superheroes, DC specifically. Superman [1978] was my favorite film.
								</p>
								<p>
									When I moved out here, I got a job with [Richard] Dick Donner, who directed Superman [screenplay by Mario Puzo and David Newman and Leslie Newman & Robert Benton]. I cold-called his office. I said, “I’m looking for an internship.” They said, “Hold on,” and transferred me to somebody else. They kept transferring me around, and then I heard this big booming voice go, “Hello?” And it was Dick. I said, “I’m  looking for an internship.” He shouted out, “Hey, someone get this kid an internship!” And I started the next day. I worked for him for four years.
									</p>
								<p>Working on this stuff in any medium has always been my dream. I love these heroes. I love this universe and world. That’s why Patty is so amazing, because what Donner was to Superman, Patty is to Wonder Woman. She brings that epic filmmaking and heart and craft and love and care and passion to the character. She sees it in such a majestic, mythical way that really gets to the heart of people. It’s not just a superhero film</p>
								<p><strong>Patty, your career in the arts began with painting at the Cooper Union in New York City. How did you transition to filmmaking?
								</strong></p>
								<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> From a very young age, I was obsessed with the arts and whatever was cool and new and interesting in music. And then as I got older, I started getting into xeroxing and photography and experimenting. Living in the Midwest, they sort of say you’re either a graphic artist or a fine artist. I was like, I guess I’m a fine artist.</p>

										<div class="col-lg-6">
											<p>I was obsessed with going to Cooper Union, and so I focused on painting and the skills I needed to get into that school. But as soon as I got in, I took an experimental film course. I remember I put a song to the first piece of footage that was ever shot slow-mo of a woman spinning in a dress. It was shot in like the turn of the century. And then I got all of this military footage from Vietnam of bombs dropping, and I would put different music to that, and I was hooked. It was the first time I had a truly authentic, extremely deep relationship to art where I couldn’t stop and you had to drag me out of a room.</p>
											<p>My mom is a film buff and I’ve lived overseas, so I’d been seeing international film and very avant-garde film my whole life. I just never realized you could be a filmmaker. That never occurred to me. The second I sat down and thought that I could do music and I could do image and I could make you feel something…. That was all I wanted

								<p><strong>Your first writing credit was 2003’s Monster, which you also directed. Between then and now, much of your focus has been on directing, and a lot of it in TV. Can you elaborate on your background in writing and directing, prior to Wonder Woman?</strong></p>
								<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> I have written and directed everything I had ever done in my life leading up to Monster. And then I was writing a lot during those in-between years. It’s just for whatever reason that we won’t go into, I was having a very hard time getting the films that I wrote made after Monster. Everybody wanted to hire me to do their films. People were not as interested in reading my scripts.</p>


								<div class="row  gx-xxl-5 box-2-column">
									<div class="col-lg-6">
										<p>And then I had my son and jumped onto [directing] TV, but I’ve never not been writing. You can’t not be a writer. To me, the two things are one. There was a period of time when I came out of that and I couldn’t get my movie made, I read the most genius script by Dave Callaham [called Jackpot, unproduced]. It required nothing. That opened me to a new relationship to writing, particularly as I’m doing these bigger movies, where I have access to much better writers than myself to collaborate with.</p>
										<p><strong>Dave Callaham:</strong> This has been the defining relationship of my career.</p>
										<p><strong>How do you all work together as cowriters?</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> If one of us hit a wall, the other one came up with an answer. That blew my mind on this project.</p>
										<p><strong>Callaham:</strong> I think sometimes too we would get in a room and be like, “Oh, my god. How are we going to figure this out?” And then ten minutes later we were like…

								<p><strong>Callaham:</strong> It’s always just fun to be in a room together. I think that’s why it was so productive and efficient. There is an understanding we all shared, so when we talked about story, we were already 75% of the way there.</p>
								<p  class="pb-3"><strong>Jenkins:</strong> And usually you’re so alone in that process.</p>

										</p>
										<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> He does that all the time. He’s so fast.</p>

										<p><strong>Dave, your writing resume consists of a lot of action movies mixed in with some superhero movies, including Doom, The Expendables trilogy, and the  upcoming Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Marvel’s first film with an Asian lead. All definitely high on action, but also often on humor. Can you tell me about your background and how Wonder Woman 1984 came to you?</strong></p>

								<p><strong>Callaham:</strong> Similar to Patty, I did not grow up thinking I was going to be a writer or wanting to be a writer. I was raised in a household where movies were not readily available to me. I grew up in the ’80s and so only when I was able to go to friends’ houses and started doing overnights and stuff, was I able to see what movies were. And at the time movies were Arnold Schwarzenegger and action movies. I was a very small kid and I would look at those guys as essentially superheroes, honestly. I was very drawn to it, but I didn’t understand that someone wrote that. </p>
